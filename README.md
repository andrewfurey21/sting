# sting-lang

Small compiler and bytecode vm for a programming language based on clox from [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). It has variables and for loops and functions and gc. That's about it.

## cool stuff to read up on later.

- [ ] register vs stack instructions (lua5 vs python)
- [ ] string interning
- [ ] hash caching
- [ ] accessing globals that don't exist yet should panic at compile time.
- [ ] actually take car with saving line info, maybe make small compiler-explorer? like CE=1, could use protobuf
